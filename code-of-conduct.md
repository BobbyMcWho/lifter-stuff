# Tidelift Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We believe that building a welcoming environment for all project contributors is an important part of a professional, mature open source project, and also simply the right thing to do.

Because of this, all lifters and Tidelift employees pledge to make participation in projects supported by Tidelift a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our standards

Examples of positive behavior, that we seek to support and celebrate, include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Prioritizing community health over individual community members
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Taking responsibility for mistakes by listening carefully, apologizing sincerely, and correcting the behavior in the future.

* Examples of unacceptable behavior, that we will handle as described below, include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

All behaviors should seek to build an environment that is positive and constructive for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies whenever a lifter is interacting with contributors to a project that they lift. Interaction with a project's contributors can happen either publicly (such as posting via a project's social media account or dealing with GitHub issues) or privately (such as contacting a contributor through an instant messaging app).

This Code of Conduct also applies within any communications channels hosted by Tidelift, and communications amongst lifters or between lifters and Tidelift employees.

Tidelift does not generally monitor the personal social media accounts of lifters, but we can take such activity into account when it impacts the environment for contributors of a lifted project.

This Code of Conduct does not replace any existing policies of a lifted project. Where such policies exist, lifters are expected to follow both policies

## Resolving violations

If you believe you or others have experienced behavior that violates this policy, you can report it by contacting Tidelift at <conduct@tidelift.com>. This address reaches Luis Villa, our head of community, and Brenna Heaps, our developer engagement lead. Tidelift will promptly review all reports, and maintain the reporter's confidentiality.

Tidelift believes that mistakes can be an opportunity for learning, and we will respect and encourage genuine attempts to listen, apologize, and improve future behavior.

When education and apology are insufficient or inappropriate (including but not limited to severe or repeated behaviors) we have the right and responsibility to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate our relationship with any lifter or Tidelift employee.

## Tidelift's additional responsibilities

We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior. As part of this, anyone involved with Tidelift or a project associated with Tidelift is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines by emailing conduct@tidelift.com. We will strive to respond promptly to all good-faith questions.

We will also seek to regularly update this Code of Conduct and other Tidelift documentation to reflect what we've learned.

Tidelift employees are held to a higher standard than lifters. If they create an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
