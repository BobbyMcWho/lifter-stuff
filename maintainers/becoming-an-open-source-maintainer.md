The path to becoming an open source maintainer is different for everyone, but everyone had to get started somewhere. Many maintainers write about their experiences and there are great resources such as [GitHub’s community stories](https://github.com/open-source/stories) and [Nadia Eghbal’s compilation](https://github.com/nayafia/awesome-maintainers) of talks, interviews, and blog posts about the experience of maintaining an open source project. 


Many maintainers cite the uncertainty, and sometimes fear, they encountered prior to contributing for the first time. In [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@left_pad/ossthanks-some-thoughts-d0267706c2c60), Babel maintainer [Henry Zhu](https://twitter.com/left_pad?source=user_profile---------------------------) talked about the anxiety he experienced submitting his first pull request. Two years later he announced he quit his job to work on Babel full time.

Some maintainers begin contributing to a project to make improvements and increase their own productivity. [Olivier Tassinari](https://blog.tidelift.com/material-ui-vs-lego-how-olivier-tassinari-became-a-core-maintainer-of-the-popular-react-component-library) discovered Material-UI in early 2015 when he was still a student and was looking for a way to save some time on an app he was building. 
 
> “I was studying, building an app, and from time to time, I was contributing pull requests to the project because, basically, I wanted to get more done. It was my first real contribution to open source and I didn't know what to expect from it. I was all in. [I thought,]  ‘I’m gonna give, give, give time and see what I get out of it.’”

For many maintainers, new projects are born when the existing projects don’t quite fit their needs. [Evan You](https://blog.tidelift.com/vuejs-evan-you-javascript-framework), creator of Vue.js, came up with the idea for Vue after graduate school, when he worked at Google Creative Lab.
 
> “We used Angular 1 in some projects, and there are parts of Angular 1 that I liked and there are parts that I felt I just don’t really need. Vue started as an experimentation to extract some parts–[specifically, for] building a web application.”
 
Sometimes what you need doesn’t exist, so you have to create it. [John Leider](https://blog.tidelift.com/how-vuetify-helped-john-leider-create-a-better-work-life-balance) was working at Fast Forward Academy when he started creating Vuetify. 
 
> “My boss said I was really good at using tools, but not creating things from scratch,” John said. “So I said, ‘OK, challenge accepted.’”
