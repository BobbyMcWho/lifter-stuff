# Lifter stuff

Thank you for visiting the lifter stuff repo! One of the ways we plan to support open source maintainers is by providing useful and interesting material like documentation and podcasts that help make maintenance more effective and more fun. But we can’t do it alone. We value your thoughts and experiences and encourage you to share them here so others can benefit. 

## How to contribute

We’re aiming to post new material regularly. We’d love your help making it better, including:

* Corrections: what did we get wrong? 
* Improvements: what can we do better? Stories? Examples? Links?
* Next steps: what can we do that is useful for you? Something that builds off work we’ve done in the past?

To contribute, please:

* Open a PR if you’d like to suggest an edit, or share a story, example, or link
* Open an issue if you have an idea for new content that you’d like to see 

## How the content will be used

At the end of the week we’ll begin content revisions based on your feedback and input, then post the content the following week as follows:

* In this repo
* On the Tidelift blog

## Guidelines and expectations
All lifters must abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tidelift/lifter-stuff/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), and we expect anyone else participating in this repo to do the same. As a result, we expect (and will require) a kind, respectful, harassment-free experience in this repo.

Please report any concerns to conduct@tidelift.com.
