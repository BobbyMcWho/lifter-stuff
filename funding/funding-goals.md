One of the most common question we hear related to open source software development is “how do developers who are running open source projects make money?” While there are lots of options out there for funding open source software development, they are not all created equal. It can be confusing to navigate all the options, and it can take time to experiment and find a good fit. So how do you decide what’s right for your project?

## The key options for funding open source software development
[Nadia Eghbal’s lemonade-stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) is an amazing resource that explores several different options, including:

* Donations: Add a donation button to the project site. 
* Bounties: Companies or projects issue “bounties” for bug fixes.
* Crowdfunding: Use services like Patreon to find recurring sponsors.
* Advertising: Sell space to advertisers.
* Consulting: Offer consulting and services for the project.
* Paid support or subscription: Users pay for maintainers to support and maintain the project. 

Before making any decisions be sure to consider the project itself and how funding might help or hurt the overall project health. Think about how the money will be used, make sure you’re comfortable with what the funding source requires, and think about how much time you’ll need to invest in order to reach your goal. 

### Setting a goal
Setting a financial goal will help you determine which funding sources might work best for your project. Is it short-term funding to hire a contractor for a specific project? Or longer term funding so that you can become a full time maintainer? Once you know that you’ll be in a better position to decide which funding options give you the best chance of achieving your goal. 

For example, projects that pursue donations and bounties can often collect small amount of funding, but often this is not recurring revenue. This means that developers can spend a lot of time “chasing” new funding, which takes time away from development work. 

On the other hand, getting the project funded by taking a job at a company that pays you to work on it, or setting your project up as part of the Tidelift Subscription may offer better opportunities for more consistent, ongoing funding. 

Talk to your co-maintainers about the overall project goals and determine what funding is needed to get there before you move forward. 

### Setting the tone
Make sure all project maintainers are comfortable with the funding sources. Options like advertising space on project sites can make users feel uncomfortable if you’re not transparent about how they work (no tracking). Similarly, asking for donations can be an uncomfortable (and time consuming!) process, where the maintainer feels bad for approaching companies—or worse, individuals and friends—asking for money to help support their open source project.

### Getting realistic about bandwidth
Some funding sources require more attention and maintenance, and you should consider this when deciding what’s right for your project. Consulting services work well for some, but it can take time away from the project work, and consulting work only scales to the extent that there are hours in the day to spend on it. Many open source project maintainers who pursue consulting options find that their time becomes consumed by consulting work, leaving little time for new development and ongoing maintenance.

### Start experimenting
Once you have a goal and a sense of which funding sources might work best for your project, start experimenting! Sometimes it takes trying a few different things to find out what works best for your project, and sometimes what works for one project doesn’t work for another.

If you’d like to read stories about open source maintainers who have successfully funded their work, maintainer [Evan You of Vue talks about how a hobby became his full time job](https://blog.tidelift.com/vuejs-evan-you-javascript-framework), and [this interview with maintainer John Leider of Vuetify](v) talks about his transition to working on Vuetify full time. 

Raising money isn’t easy, and it can take a lot of time away that could be better spent focusing on maintaining and improving your project. Tidelift’s goal is to help open source maintainers increase their impact and lower their stress with a recurring source of income.
